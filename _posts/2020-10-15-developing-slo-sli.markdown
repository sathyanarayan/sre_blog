Make Sure you have read [previous post] [previous post] before reading this one

The process of developing SLIs and SLOs for a user trace can be broken into following steps.

* what types of SLI you want to measure for the user journey, and set specifications for these SLIs
* Describe which events have to be measured, any validity restrictions to the scope of the SLI. Also define what makes an 
event good and which all are valid events.
* Weigh the pros and cons of the various measurement strategies, and figure out where and how the SLI will be measured
* SLI implementations need to be detailed enough that someone could build or configure monitoring infrastructure to gather the
data without needing to consult 
* Document on the failure modes that your SLIs won’t capture, hopefully there won’t be many.
* choose your measurement window and set some SLO targets, either based on historical data or can estimate based on the 
business requirement 

### Example :

The above is an example of user journey of viewing the product details in the app. I have considered the above route and 
keeping it simple. In actual scenario the response would be obtained via connecting to multiple micro services. What do you
think the users expectation would be on selecting the product seen in the search page? what would make them happy and unhappy?.
The client's browser/app will make a https request to the server which the load balancer will route to one of the
web servers to serve the response. The JS and CSS assets will be pulled via the CDN by the client, and the page is compiled 
at client side and full product detail page is shown to the user. From a user perspective, the user would be happy only 
if the page loads as quickly as possible, displaying all the details. This example is more over like a Request/Response interaction, 
so we want to measure both the availability and latency metrics are measured. This raises a question: what does successful 
loading of page or when we say quickly loaded means?. When we define the SLI it should be clear, what, where and how are 
we measuring the SLI’s. When you are pre-paring a SLI document, it should be pretty clear, anyone with that document should 
just be able to start without any concerns or queries. Coming back to this scenario so we have decided availability and 
latency are the metrics we need to measure, for measuring the availability, let's say we need to check if the page/product 
page was successfully served or not for this we could depend on the status code response, which would get recorded in the 
load balancer as it returns the response. To be more precise, we could tell let's say, consider all requests with request 
path /api/product<id>, where response is not 500 and 429 should be considered as successful. Now considering the next one 
latency: all response within y milliseconds should be considered as good response. For this we could again use the LB, 
using https GET request to product page, of which all were responded within or less than y milliseconds.

There could be lot of gaps, in the settings we have done we always need to walk through the user journey and consider 
if the chosen measurement strategy will observe the SLI metrics, if the infrastructure fails. That is let's say if the 
load balancer is down, our SLI metrics won't be populating and we wouldn't be knowing what's happening. This clearly calls 
out that the postmortem or Root cause analysis is always important, as it would not only able to help you find the issue 
but also help in placing the right metrics and methods to monitor. One solution I think is to create a one-box stage in 
my pipeline to which ill be supplying synthetic traffic and would be monitoring the response, and will also we watching 
on missing or empty data/monitoring points. Capturing all the falls at first go for complex systems are always unrealistic, 
it would always be an incremental enhancement.
