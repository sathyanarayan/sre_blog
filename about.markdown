Author : S.SATHYANARAYAN 

Hi! I’m Sathyanarayan! am a SysDev, with 3 yrs of experience in IT Industry. I started my journey as support engineer, 
where I gained my knowledge in maintaining and making the production systems reliable. Have you ever :) had night-mares of 
getting bombarded with the pages during oncall. I enjoy fixing a stale pipleline and making it full CD. Now am mostly 
into automating, and developing tools to make the SRE life’s easier.
